This is intended to function as the backend for Crowd Flow. This project 
is still under development. Currently I am testing out different methods 
for identifying crowds (high density concentrations of users). 

About Crowd Flow:

Crowd Flow is a mobile app to be developed that will allow users to see 
what's going on in their area via the flow of crowds. Users will be able 
to see concentrations of crowds (other users) in their area to determine 
what events/places are currently popular.
